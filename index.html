Starlit Night is an extremely intelligent mare. During her foalhood and quite a few years of adulthood, Starry had been a sweet but mischievous filly, enjoying activities such as playing tag, playing in the rain, pulling pranks, etc. 
    
Immortality, however, didn't do her any favours, and the constant deaths and battles wore down on her. The last straw was when her love, erebus, went missing. Even though she knew that he, being immortal couldn't die, it still broke her and a=she started wearing a harsh, cold fa√ßade in order to disguise her true feelings and not get attached to anypony, even distancing herself from other gods.
